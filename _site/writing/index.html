</center>

<p>It was the winter of 2017, and I was home for Christmas break. I had just completed my first semester of university at UC Berkeley and would be spending the next two weeks at home, in the confines my room, which I remember to be particularly moody. I have a memory of the pink walls being dark, almost grey, and the soft orange light sifting through my window blinds as day gave over to night. My room felt both oppressive and romantic that night. Open on my ThinkPad was VLC Media Player, the only source of light. Playing on it was Welcome to the N.H.K. It was my first time watching it. Little did I know that what began in that moment would lead me six years later, in the summer of 2023, returning to the same emotions I felt that night, except now it was the anime in real life confronting me as a I walked through the streets of Tama-ku.</p>

<p>Tama-ku is one of the seven wards (subdivision of a city) of the city of Kawasaki in the Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan. It is just under an hour west, by train, from Tokyo. Tama-ku is a small town that borders the Tama River. A smaller Hirase River that branches from the Tama River runs through it. A steep set of stairs with bright red handrails leads to the top of a hill on which the Gotanda Shrine sits. Here, there is a majestic view of the town and the Hirase River. As I stood there, I wondered how Satou would have felt looking at that view. In his deep anguish, perhaps he felt nothing. Perhaps he had lived there for so long by then that familiarity had bred into numbness. The thought of this made me sad.</p>

<p>Although not officially mentioned, Welcome to the N.H.K. draws much of its visual identity from this town. Many scenes are reproductions of locations in Tama-ku, including the park where Satou and Misaki have their lessons and their homes. Tatsuhiko Takimoto, the author of the novel that the anime is based on, used to live here as a hikikomori.</p>

<p>It is well known that Welcome to the N.H.K. draws from its author’s own experience as a hikikomori. In a blog post<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, Takimoto describes how much of his mental health stability can be attributed to his friend Uminekozawa Melon who, when he was living as a hikikomori in Tama-ku, would take him out to places on his motorbike. Perhaps he was a source of inspiration for Misaki and Yamazaki.</p>

<p>Welcome to the N.H.K begins by introducing the character, Satou. He had dropped out of college and was living as a hikikomori and NEET, something which he is deeply ashamed of. He has developed a fear of going outside and spends all his time indoors. He lives off the money that his mother occasionally sends. The more time he spends isolated, the more that his inferiority complex grows and his fear of the outside world. It is a bleak cycle, with seemingly little hope for escape.</p>

<p>It was a Tuesday when I had planned to explore Tama-ku.  I had left for it from Gotokuji Station at around 6 PM. I was worried because it was getting dark. I had spent the day distracted with exploring the Gotoku-ji Temple, the rumored birthplace of mineki-neko, a cat figurine that brings good luck to the owner. If you have been in any Chinese or Japanese restaurant, you have probably seen it.</p>

<center>
<figure>

  <figcaption>Ceramic mineki-neko figurines in Gotoku-ji Temple.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>The Gotoku-ji Temple is joyful yet sullen. It is joyful because on top of the shrines and stone ledges are thousands of cute, ceramic mineki-neko figurines. Whispered into each of them were the wishes of their owners. Inside of them held the dreams of entire generations, of the old and young, and of the dramatic and routine. From what I saw, you are to purchase one of these dolls, make a wish, and then place them somewhere in the temple. Conveniently, a gift shop within walking distance sold them.</p>

<p>The sun was particularly bright that summer day, and I recall how the sunlight sifted through the translucent green leaves as I gazed at the thousands of cats staring back. It had taken five minutes to walk to the temple from the train station, and sweat was already dripping down my back.</p>

<p>If you are wondering whether I purchased a cat, the answer is that I did. Did I leave it at the temple? No. My tendency for collection outweighed my spiritual interest. In fact, I don’t think I even made a wish. Upon reflection, I clearly missed out on something about the temple, an experience which I can conceive of intellectually but not emotionally. I was a foreigner looking in from the outside, and perhaps I would never return there again.</p>

<p>As I walked past the entrance, I found myself going down a forested, stone path. The further I went, the more the voices of people died down until I was by myself. At the same time, a cloud drifted over the sun and suddenly it was much darker. At the end of the path was an old cemetery. The chilled wind brushed against my clothes as I looked at the tombs. Lesser known about the temple is that it also houses the tombs of the li clan, who were lords of the Hikone Domain during the Edo period.</p>

<p>I was in the center of the temple now, past its exterior. It occurred to me that just a hundred meters back, there was a crowd of people celebrating life. They were making wishes, creating dreams, and taking pictures of the cats. Every single person back there was walking down the road of life towards potential. Yet, where I stood, I saw the end of that road. The alive are, after all, only one step from the dead. In the shadow of the clouds, the leaves took on a deep green.</p>

<p>I arrived at Ikuta Station at 7 PM, which is in the center of Tama-ku. By now, the sun was already setting. Why had I been so drawn to Welcome to the N.H.K.? It was a question worth asking—after all, even six years later I found myself making the journey to see the locations of the anime in real life.</p>

<p>I have always been a romantic in my depiction of life. I think that people like me, because of this, are appreciative (and hence, attached) to media and art which get it <em>just right</em>. That film which portrays the exact flavor of melancholy you feel in your life is suddenly very important. I will write down the name of that film, and add some thoughts on it if I am brave. It leaves a lasting impression on me that reminds me that feelings, even bad ones, can still be beautiful.</p>

<p>I am also someone who enjoys creating. Experiencing beautiful media inspires me to create it myself. Welcome to the N.H.K. captured something that resided in me when I watched it. In helping me process what I felt, I hope to put that forward.</p>

<p>Satou and Misaki first meet when Misaki and her aunt knock on his door. They are canvassing for religious reasons and are handing out a magazine targeted towards NEETs (Not in Education, Employment, or Training)—the exact condition that Satou is ashamed to be experiencing. This encounter encourages him to find a job. He goes to his local manga café to apply for one only to find Misaki working in the front counter. The encounter is hilariously endearing as Satou is shocked and stutters his way out of the building, too afraid to reveal why he went there—to do so would reveal that he is a NEET! The actual location that the manga café is modeled after is right next to Ikuta station. In its place, at present, is a bar named Yuunagi.</p>

<center>
<figure>
  <img src="/files/exploring welcome to the nhk in real life/manga_cafe.jpg" alt="In the location that the manga café is modeled after is a bar with an expensive cover fee." width="80%" />
  <figcaption>In the location that the manga café is modeled after is a bar with an expensive cover fee.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>I wanted to go inside, but the cover fee was outrageous. This was deduced by looking online for information about the place. Perhaps now, I should interject the truth. I didn’t go inside because I was too shy—I didn’t speak Japanese—and the cover fee, while indeed outrageous, was a convenient excuse. I have always been shy in this way, careful to expose myself to social awkwardness. It is in this way that Welcome to the N.H.K. fulfilled a particularly charming fantasy.</p>

<p>A cute girl wants to “save” me from my asociality? In one, fell swoop she further rescues my dating life. She wants to help me—and is willing to put in all the work! It is all too convenient and attractive for any person unwilling, perhaps because he is too afraid, to put in the work. For Satou, it is a surprisingly turn of events. A generous, outside force has come in and yanked him out of his cycle. He is now on the path to recovery. As life would have it, however, nothing is that simple.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting things for myself has been to consider how my understanding of Misaki has developed over time and how it relates to my life in context. When I first watched it, I was in a dark place. To me, she was my escape. The question that filled my head was: when will my Misaki come? This was, of course, a reflection of the fact that I was afraid. Because I was incapable of acting—or, at least, felt like it—Misaki to me meant something that came from the outside world and yanked me out of my present situation. As far as I could tell, it was the only way out.</p>

<p>Across the manga café is a tall building where, in a future episode, Satou and Yamazaki (Satou’s one and only friend who lives next door) eat popsicles while waiting for Misaki’s shift to end. They intend to follow Misaki home to find out who she really is. As they suspect, to wholly believe in her words—that her intention is to save Sato, and by now she has had numerous sessions with him at the park—is perhaps too naïve.</p>

<center>

  <figcaption>The building across from the manga café where Satou and Yamazaki wait for Misaki’s shift to end.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>Upon returning home embarrassed after running into Misaki at the manga café when looking for a job, he dozes off and has fantasies of her. His sleep is suddenly interrupted by a ring on his doorbell. He tentatively heads towards the door—he has a feeling who it is—and finds a letter dropped off by Misaki who quickly runs away. Opening the letter, he finds an odd proposal: Misaki says that she has selected him for her project, and that he is to go to Mita Park at 9 PM that night.</p>

<p>Satou, in a leap of faith, makes the decision to go to the park. Life is determined by sharply diverging branches—as Satou would find out, the path he is about to embark will take him to places that with fear he could not reach. At the park is an infamous sign: the “beware of molesters” sign. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that it’s real!</p>

</center>

<p>At Mita Park, Misaki presents Satou with a contract. Upon signing, he is to agree to attending nightly sessions where she will help him recover from his hikikomori condition. When he hesitates, she assures him that all she wants to do is help him.</p>

</center>

<p>By the time that I reached the park, it was pitch black. It had also started raining and the ground was getting muddy. The park was being renovated and it seemed that they had removed the colorful block wall and benches where Misaki and Satou had their lessons. From what I could tell, only the clock remained.</p>

<p>There is a lovely scene in both the novel and anime where Misaki feeds a stray cat at the park. As luck would have it, I came across three cats in the very same park! I wonder if it is known for having stray cats—and that inspired the author to put one in the story.</p>

</figure>
</center>

<p>As I was admiring the cats, the rain suddenly picked up and I had to find a place to take cover. I saw a bicycle rack with a rooftop and ran to it. By the time I reached cover, it was torrenting. I stayed there for a good twenty minutes while waiting for the rain to stop. There is a term for this that I can’t seem to recall, but in that moment, I experienced a pleasant restfulness that I sometimes get when I enter one of my romantic moods.</p>

<p>I was in a foreign place rediscovering, for a second time, the emotional wanderings of my more youthful mind. My thoughts were periodically interrupted by the thunder. I realized that I didn’t feel this way as often as I did before. There was a time when I experienced life in a more romantic, if turbulent way. I couldn’t help but wonder if in what stability gave me in terms of my mental health, I had also lost something.</p>

<p>When Misaki finally finishes her shift, Satou and Yamazaki follow her. They eventually reach a steep hill upon which they walk up. To their surprise, Misaki opens the front door to the mansion on top of the hill. To their bewilderment, they realize that from the hill, from Misaki’s home, they can see the entirety of the park in which they had been meeting up. And furthermore, as they round the corner, they realize that she can also see Satou’s apartment from the hill—and straight through his window into his room!</p>

<p>It dawns on him that Misaki had likely been watching him the entire time. Watching as he wasted his days, weeks, and months in that little room of his. She must have known even before meeting me about how pathetic I am! So, what does she want with me? he wonders.</p>

<center>

</figure>
</center>

<p>Satou’s realization is as equally shocking as it reveals a truism about life: that nothing is as it seems. As we soon find out, Misaki’s lessons with Satou are as much about saving herself as they are about saving him.</p>

</center>

<p>Misaki is not a supernatural force that saves Satou from his own destruction. Misaki has her own problems—and she uses Satou as a crutch to address them. The circumstances of their meeting and the seemingly unproductive emotions that they inflict on each other are not ideal. To contemplate on counterfactuals, on ideal circumstances, to ask: what did I actually need? however, is the wrong way to think about it. Satou and Misaki were to each other what they needed in the moment.</p>

<p>Society structures our lives and choices. It furnishes us with a set of circumstances. All we can do is to try our best with what we have. In the end, Satou and Misaki learned and grew from the experience—and that is all you can ask for in life.</p>

<p>So, who is Misaki, then? This was the question I was contemplating six years later, in the summer of 2023, as I stood in the rain. My conclusion was this: Misaki represents something both outside, the context in which you live, as well as something already inside you. The synthesis of the two is what gives birth to growth. The answer to my original question—when will my Misaki come?—is that she is already here.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The anime ends with Misaki presenting Satou with a new contract. It states they will both be hostages to each other. In this way, they promise to stay alive, if for nothing at all but so the other may live.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> While reading the new contract—this is my favorite moment—Satou comments how even though they have been through so much, none of their problems have really been solved. That although things seem better, they may very well return to their old ways. For now, though, he is hanging in there and will give it his best shot.</p>

<h1 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h1>

<p>I am now reminded of the term that I could not recall when describing my experience under the bicycle rack during the torrenting rain: mono no aware. I have grown since the first time I watched Welcome to the N.H.K. My deep appreciation for this is not without a sense of sadness at what has also been lost.</p>

<p>I have one final suggestion for those interested in hearing the haunting, anxious, ecstasy of Welcome to the N.H.K. First, listen to the following two songs from the show’s soundtrack: Hitori no Tame no Lullaby by Pearl Brothers and then Youkoso! Hitori Bocchi by Pearl Brothers. Then, finish with PPP by Beach House.</p>

<h1 id="what-does-tatsuhiko-takimoto-say">What Does Tatsuhiko Takimoto Say?</h1>

<p>I have always wondered what Takimoto had intended to convey to the reader and how it reflected himself. He has a website<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> where he sometimes posts updates on. I recently stumbled upon a trove of old blog posts, which I found illuminating.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he has deleted all his old blog posts. Luckily, many can be found on the Internet Archive<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. He was a prolific blogger, often posting more than once a week since at least 2015. The Internet Archive trail ends in 2017, which is when I presume he deleted his blogs. They are all written in Japanese, so I hope that my reading of Google Translate is accurate to what he meant to write.</p>

<p>Reading his blog, I developed an appreciation for how profoundly reflective the novel is of the author himself. In reading his blog and his descriptions of his life—and he is a very open person—I couldn’t help but realize how much in watching the show and reading the novel, I was really reading into Takimoto. He was acutely aware of this, to the point pain. In the first afterword of the English release of his novel (published in 2007), he writes, reproduced in full:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the beginning of the twenty-first century, the hikikomori phenomenon suddenly broke out wildly across Japan.</p>

  <p>As a sharp-eyed man, I thought I’d jump on the tide of the times and earn a ton of money. I’ll write a story about hikikomori and become famous! I’ll become a best-selling author with my hikikomori story! I’ll go to Hawaii using the royalties! I’ll go to Waikiki!</p>

  <p>My dreams stretched out endlessly. However, once I actually started trying to write the story, I soon regretted it. It was painful.</p>

  <p>What happens when a real hikikomori writes a hikikomori story? Inevitably, you start having to use your own experiences in your creation. You start having to write about yourself.</p>

  <p>Of course, stories are fiction, and no matter how much one of the characters I used looks like me, he is himself, and I am myself. Even if we speak the same way and live in the same apartment, we are still unconnected. We inhabit separate worlds.</p>

  <p>Regardless, it was still painful. It was embarrassing. I felt as though I were taking my own shame and revealing it to the whole world.</p>

  <p>In the end, I got caught up in paranoid fantasies.</p>

  <p>What if everyone is secretly laughing at me while I write this kind of story? I really thought this.</p>

  <p>In truth, I still can’t read this story objectively.</p>

  <p>Each time I reread it, I start to have light hallucinations. I break into a cold sweat.</p>

  <p>Each time I approach one of a few specific places in the plot, I start wanting to throw the computer out the window.</p>

  <p>At other particular points, I start wanting to run away from home to live deep in secrecy in the mountains of India.</p>

  <p>That was probably because the themes addressed in this story are not things of the past for me but currently active problems.</p>

  <p>I can’t look at it from afar, thinking, “How young I was then.”</p>

  <p>This is all a real problem.</p>

  <p>For the time being, I went ahead and wrote the whole thing. I decided to write everything I could. And what came out of it was this story.</p>

  <p>Reading back over it, my face turning red… well, how is it, really?</p>

  <p>When I read it on days when I’m in a good mood, I think. Amazing! I’m a genius!</p>

  <p>And on days when I’m depressed, I think, I suck to have written something like this! Die right now!</p>

  <p>Even so, I think that what is probably true about it is simply: I wrote everything I could possibly write.</p>

  <p>Well then, hello, everyone. My name is Tatsuhiko Takimoto. This is my Afterword, for my second book.</p>

  <p>I owe a lot to many people this time around, too. Everyone who had something to do with this book and everyone who is reading it, thank you so very much.</p>

  <p>I still will do my best after this. I will get pumped up and try hard.</p>

  <p>Tatsuhiko Takimoto</p>

  <p>December, 2001</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can only admire Takimoto for his bravery in putting out a work which, as much as it made so many people heard and understood, at the same time made him feel so naked.</p>

<p>He has a post<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> where he describes how he originally got the idea to write the novel. He was walking home in the 2000s from Ikuta station to his apartment contemplating his next novel. He concluded that he wanted to write something that would inspire people like himself. The idea for the title Welcome to the N.H.K. came when he was watching Kōhaku Uta Gassen (a Japanese show where singers compete) at his parents’ house during the New Year holidays.</p>

<p>He had been commissioned by a publishing company called Boiledeggs Online to write a weekly, serialized novel. The first story he submitted was rejected. He was glad it was, because his second submission, which was accepted, was of the infamous scene of Satou and Yamazaki in front of the elementary school. Indeed, this would make it into the novel and into the anime in episode 3.</p>

<p>In another post <sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>, he talks about his interpretation of Misaki. He describes the idea of hoping for Misaki to appear as ineffective. To him, you will find your Misaki when you find yourself. What you want, you must first become. He details a mental visualization technique that he uses to achieve his goals—to find Misaki, in essence. In fact, he has released an English audio of a guided meditation to evoke Misaki.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Finally, there is a post<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> where he discusses what he feels were the failures of his writing. He describes his sense of failure for not being able to write the story he wanted to write. In particular, he had trouble writing about loneliness—because in doing so he was writing about himself. As a result, he introduces what he thinks were distractions in the story so that he didn’t have to deal with the core topic he wanted to write about—hence, the introduction of Misaki. It was interesting to read his feelings towards Misaki: that she was a distraction from a story which he hoped to write that concentrated on Satou’s loneliness.</p>

<p>It is interesting to understand Misaki in this way. She was what he needed to complete the story. Yet, she was also what prevented him from writing what he wanted to.</p>

<p>Later, he concludes that perhaps it was not that bad of a story despite getting sidetracked—after all, life can often be sidetracked—and in that sense it was a realistic story. He is satisfied with the fact that the ending is ambivalent—Satou and Misaki’s problems have not been solved—because a story doesn’t need a perfect resolution. By ending it in this way, he enjoys that it was realistic and left room for future development.</p>

<p>He notes, however, that there was something that he wanted to say in the story but couldn’t. This is his message for anyone who finds themselves in a situation like Welcome to the N.H.K. (Google translated):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is always a way out.</p>

  <p>There is a way to a completely happy ending.</p>

  <p>If there was anything I wanted to write about in that book but wasn’t able to, it was this.</p>

  <p>So I’m writing this right now. Sato, Misaki, Yamazaki, and Senpai will all reach their happy ending. They’ve probably already reached that point. So a new world should already be beginning.</p>

  <p>What I wanted to write about was not human weakness. No matter how weak and lost energy a person may be in the tangled labyrinth of their mind, they can always find their way out and get back to themselves.</p>

  <p>By writing down this conviction that I wasn’t able to express in the story, I have now completed my “Welcome to the NHK!”</p>
