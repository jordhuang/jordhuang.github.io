<p>It was the winter of 2017, and I was home for Christmas break. I had just completed my first semester of university at UC Berkeley and would be spending the next two weeks at home, in the confines my room, which I remember to be particularly moody. I have a memory of the pink walls being dark, almost grey, and the soft orange light sifting through my window blinds as day gave over to night. My room felt both oppressive and romantic that night. Open on my ThinkPad was VLC Media Player, the only source of light. Playing on it was Welcome to the N.H.K. It was my first watching it. Little did I know that what began in that moment would lead me six years later, in the summer of 2023, returning to the same emotions I felt that night, except now it was the anime in real life confronting me as a I walked through the streets of Tama-ku.</p>

<p>Tama-ku is one of the seven wards (subdivision of a city) of the city of Kawasaki in the Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan. It is just under an hour away west, by train, from Tokyo. Tama-ku is a small town that borders the Tama River. A smaller Hirase River that branches from the Tama River runs through it. A steep set of stairs with bright red handrails leads to the top of a hill on which the Gotanda Shrine sits. Here, there is a majestic view of the town and the Hirase River. As I stood there, I wondered how Satou would have felt looking at that view. In his deep anguish, perhaps he felt nothing. Perhaps he had lived there for so long by then that familiarity had bred into numbness. The thought of this made me sad.</p>

<p>Although not mentioned officially, Welcome to the N.H.K. draws much of its visual identity from this town. Many scenes are reproductions of locations in Tama-ku, including the park where Satou and Misaki have their lessons and their homes. Tatsuhiko Takimoto, the author of the novel that the anime is based on, used to live here as a hikikomori.</p>

<p>It is well known that Welcome to the N.H.K. draws from its author’s own experience as a hikikomori. In a blog post<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, Takimoto describes how much of his mental health stability can be attributed to his friend Uminekozawa Melon who, when he was living as a hikikomori in Tama-ku, would take him out to places on his motorbike. Perhaps he was a source of inspiration for Misaki and Yamazaki.</p>

<p>The first episode describes how Satou had dropped out of college and was living as a hikikomori and NEET, something which he is deeply ashamed of. He has developed a fear of going outside and spends all his time indoors. He lives off the money that his mother occasionally sends. The more time he spends isolated, the more that he his inferiority complex grows and his fear of the outside world. It is a bleak cycle, with seemingly little hope for escape.</p>

<p>It was a Tuesday when I had planned to explore Tama-ku.  I had left for it from Gotokuji Station at around 6 PM. I was worried because it was getting dark. I had spent the day distracted with exploring the Gotoku-ji Temple, the rumored birthplace of mineki-neko, a cat figurine that brings good luck to the owner. If you have been in any Chinese or Japanese restaurant, you have probably seen it.</p>

<p>The Gotoku-ji Temple is joyful yet sullen. It is joyful because on top of the shrines and stone ledges are thousands of cute, ceramic mineki-neko figurines. Whispered into each of them were the wishes of their owners. Inside of them held the dreams of entire generations, of the old and young, and of the dramatic and routine. From what I saw, you are to purchase one of these dolls, make a wish, and then place them somewhere in the temple. Conveniently, a gift shop within walking distance sold them. The sun was particularly bright that summer day, and I recall how the sunlight sifted through the translucent green leaves as I gazed at the thousands of cats staring back. It had taken five minutes to walk to the temple from the train station, and sweat was already dripping down my back.</p>

<p>As I walked past the entrance, I found myself going down a forested, stone path. The further I went, the more the voices of people died down until I was by myself. At the same time, a cloud drifted over the sun and suddenly it was much darker. At the end of the path was an old cemetery. The chilled wind brushed against my clothes as I looked at the tombs. Lesser known about the temple is that it also houses the tombs of the li clan, who were lords of the Hikone Domain during the Edo period.
I was in the center of the temple now, past its exterior, and once again I was reminded of the dual role of temples. The alive are only one step from the dead. In the shadow of the clouds, the leaves took on a deep green.</p>

<p>I arrived at Ikuta Station at 7 PM, which is in the center of Tama-ku. By now, the sun was already setting. Why had I been so drawn to Welcome to the N.H.K.? It was a question worth asking—after all, even six years later I found myself making the journey to see the locations of the anime in real life.</p>

<p>I have always been a romantic regarding my picture of life. I think that people like me, because of this, are especially appreciative (and hence, attached) to media and art which get it <em>just right</em>. That film which portrays the exact flavor of melancholy you feel in your life is suddenly very important. I will write down the name of that film, and perhaps add some thoughts on it if I am brave enough. It leaves a lasting impression on me that reminds me that feelings, even bad ones, can still be beautiful.</p>

<p>I am also someone who enjoys creating. Experiencing beautiful media inspires me to create it myself. When I consume media, I take note of the techniques that it used, of what is done well and what is not. It is in this way that I am writing this piece. Welcome to the N.H.K. captured something that resided in me when I watched it. In helping me process what I felt, I hope to now create something for the next person who reads this.</p>

<p>Satou and Misaki first meet when Misaki and her aunt knock on his door. They are canvassing for religious reasons and are handing out a magazine targeted towards NEETs (Not in Education, Employment, or Training)—the exact condition that Satou is ashamed to be experiencing. This encounter encourages him to find a job. He goes to his local manga café to apply for one only to find Misaki working in the front counter. The encounter is hilariously endearing as Satou is shocked and stutters his way out of the building, too afraid to reveal why he went there—to do so would reveal that he is a NEET! The actual location that the manga café is modeled after is right next to Ikuta station. In its place, at present, is a bar named Yuunagi.</p>

  <figcaption>In the location that the manga café is modeled after is a bar with an expensive cover fee.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>I wanted to go inside, but the cover fee was outrageous. This was deduced by looking online for information about the place. Perhaps now, I should interject the truth. I didn’t go inside because I was too shy—I didn’t speak Japanese—and the cover fee, while indeed outrageous, was a convenient excuse. I have always been shy in this way, careful to expose myself to social awkwardness. It is in this way that Welcome to the N.H.K. fulfilled a particularly charming fantasy.</p>

<p>A cute girl wants to “save” me from my asociality? In one, fell swoop she further rescues my dating life. She wants to help me—and is willing to put in all the work! It is all too convenient, and I propose, attractive for any person unwilling, perhaps because he is too afraid, to put in the work. For Satou, it is a surprisingly turn of events. A generous outside force has come in and yanked him out of his cycle. He is now on the path to recovery. As life would have it, however, nothing is that simple.</p>

<p>Across the manga café is a tall building where Satou and Yamazaki (Satou’s one and only friend who lives next door) eat popsicles while waiting for Misaki’s shift to end. They intend to follow Misaki home to find out who she really is. As they suspect, to wholly believe in her words—that her intention is to save Sato, and by now she has had numerous sessions with him at the park—is perhaps too naïve.</p>

<center>

</center>

<p>Upon returning home embarrassed after running into Misaki at the manga café when looking for a job, he dozes off and has fantasies of her. His sleep is suddenly interrupted by a ring on his doorbell. He tentatively heads towards the door—he has a feeling who it is—and finds a letter dropped off by Misaki who quickly runs away. Opening the letter, he finds an odd proposal: Misaki says that she has selected him for her project, and that he is to go to Mita Park at 9 PM that night.</p>

<p>Satou, in a leap of faith, makes the decision to go to the park. Life is determined by sharply diverging branches—as Satou would find out, the path he is about to embark will take him to places that with fear he could not reach. At the park is an infamous sign: the “beware of molesters” sign. Imagine my surprise when I discover that it’s real!</p>

<p>At Mita Park, Misaki presents Satou with a contract. Upon signing, he is to agree to attending nightly sessions where she will help him recover from his hikikomori condition. When he hesitates, she assures him that all she wants to do is help him.</p>

</center>

<p>By the time that I reached the park, it was pitch black. It had also started raining and the ground was getting muddy. The park was being renovated and it seemed that they had removed the colorful block wall and benches where Misaki and Satou had their lessons. From what I could tell, only the clock remained.</p>

<p>There is a lovely scene in both the novel and anime where Misaki feeds a stray cat at the park. As luck would have it, I came across three cats in the very same park! I wonder if it is known for having stray cats—and that inspired the author to put one in the story.</p>

</figure>
</center>

<p>As I was admiring the cats, the rain suddenly picked up and I had to find a place to take cover. I saw a bicycle rack with a rooftop and ran to it. By the time I reached cover, it was torrenting. I stayed there for a good twenty minutes while waiting for the rain to stop. There is a term for this that I can’t seem to recall, but in that moment, I experienced a pleasant restfulness that I sometimes get when I enter one of my romantic moods. I was in a foreign place rediscovering for a second time the emotional wanderings of my more youthful mind. My thoughts were periodically interrupted by the thunder. I realized that I didn’t feel this way as often as I did before. There was a time when I experienced life in a more romantic, if turbulent way. I couldn’t help but wonder if in what stability gave me in terms of my mental health, I had also lost something.</p>

<p>When Misaki finally finishes her shift, Satou and Yamazaki follow her. They eventually reach a steep hill upon which they walk up. To their surprise, Misaki opens the front door to the mansion on top of the hill. To their bewilderment, they realize that from the hill, from Misaki’s home, they can see the entirety of the park in which they had been meeting up. And furthermore, as they round the corner, they realize that she can also see Satou’s apartment from the hill—and straight through his window into his room!</p>

<p>It dawns on him that Misaki had likely been watching him the entire time. Watching as he wasted his days, weeks, and months in that little room of his. She must have known even before meeting me about how pathetic I am! So, what does she want with me? he wonders.</p>

</figure>
</center>

<p>Satou’s realization is as equally shocking as it reveals a truism about life: that nothing is as it seems. As we soon find out, Misaki’s lessons with Satou are as much about saving herself as they are about saving him.</p>

<center>

  <figcaption>Satou’s apartment. You must walk up a long hill to reach it. Parched from the summer heat, I bought a fruit tea from the vending machine. </figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

<p>It is for this reason that I like Welcome to the N.H.K. It would be too convenient for Misaki to be perfect. She has her own problems with insecurity—and she used Satou as a crutch to address it. But in the same way that the circumstances of their meeting and the seemingly unproductive emotions that they inflict on each other are not ideal, to each other they were what they needed in the moment. To contemplate on counterfactuals, on ideal circumstances, is fantasy at best and misleading at worst. In the end, they both learned and grew from the experience—and that is all you can ask for in life.</p>

<p>The anime ends with Misaki presenting Satou with a new contract. From now on, they will both be hostages to each other. In this way, they promise to stay alive, if for nothing at all but so the other may live. For those who have not watched the anime, there is much that takes place between the first and this final meeting, including themes that deal with suicide, depression, and codependency.</p>

<p>My favorite moment is when, while reading the new contract, Satou comments how even though they have been through so much, none of their problems have really been solved. That although things seem better, they may very well return to their old ways. For now, though, he is hanging in there and will give it his best shot.</p>

<h1 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h1>

<p>I am now reminded of the term that I could not recall when describing my experience under the bicycle rack during the torrenting rain. It is the same feeling that I felt when looking at Tama-ku from the hill on which Gotanda Shrine stands and when I finished watching Welcome to the N.H.K.: <em>mono no aware</em>.</p>

<p>I have one final suggestion for those interested in hearing the haunting, anxious, ecstasy of Welcome to the N.H.K. First, listen to the following two songs from the show’s soundtrack: Hitori no Tame no Lullaby by Pearl Brothers and then Youkoso! Hitori Bocchi by Pearl Brothers. Then, finish with PPP by Beach House.</p>
