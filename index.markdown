Hi! 

I am a physics PhD student working in Professor Chakram's group at Rutgers University. I am interested in developing hardware for quantum computing. I am currently exploring the control of a multimode cavity circuit quantum electrodynamics-based device. I grew up in California where I attended the University of California, Berkeley to study physics as an undergraduate.
