Hi! 

I am a physics PhD student working in the <a href="https://sites.rutgers.edu/chakram-lab/">Superconducting Quantum Systems</a> group at Rutgers University, with Professor Srivatsan Chakram. I am interested in developing hardware for quantum computing. I am currently exploring how to use superconducting circuits to control the quantum states of photons in a superconducting cavity. The goal is to implement quantum error correction using hardware-efficient bosonic schemes. I grew up in California and attended the University of California, Berkeley to study physics as an undergraduate.
